         <p>In this Section I'm going to talk about the gym,</p>
         <p>Gym is not a place nor a sport, Gym is life.</p>
         <p>the only place where I could lose all my pains and burn some memories,</p>
         <p>life is not easy at all there are gonna be challenges, and you’re gonna get beat down,</p>
         <p>that’s the way life is, sometimes you have to just back up and go within yourself and recharge your batteries,</p>
         <p>go to the gym clear your head and then come back and look at it from a different vantage point,</p>
         <p>don’t allow your emotions to control you, don’t cry to give up, cry to keep going,</p>
         <p>don’t cry to quit you already in pain you already hurt, get a reward from it, at the end of pain is a success,</p>
         <p>you are not gonna die because you feel a little pain.</p>
